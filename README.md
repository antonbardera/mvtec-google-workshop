# Workshop with Google!
Last year, COVID-19 locked us home and upended our lives. They were hard times for many, and we want to explore the relationship between **our struggles** and **our solidarity** during the pandemic using [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/): the dichotomy **Who/When/Where/What for we ask for help** and **Who/When/Where/What for we offer help**. For example financial struggles, mental health issues ... show up in the trends, but also finding ways to support Black Lives Matter pop up. 

## In this repository
In the `app` folder you'll find a boilerplate-ish template, it's similar to the `mvtec-svelte-app`, with the addition of `svelte-materialify` â€”so we don't spend too much time overdesigning the UI.

You also have a `data` folder. Think of it as the playground for your data. 

## It has to have ... 
This are *mandatory* bits you'd need to include in the piece, they can be ordered however you want though â€”yes, you can even start with something before the title! That's called a cold open.

* **Title and intro:** What am I gonna see here?
* **Guiding text:** To explain the views
* **Hero visualization:** The star of the show ðŸ¤©! Unleash your creativity!
* **Small multiples:** Still cool, but in a *cool aunt* kind of way ðŸ˜Ž
* **Filters:** They can be a dropdown menu, buttons, [chips](https://svelte-materialify.vercel.app/components/chips/) ... that transform or reduce the data you're visualizing

## Audience
General public. 

## About the data
This [post](https://medium.com/google-news-lab/what-is-google-trends-data-and-what-does-it-mean-b48f07342ee8) by [Simon Rogers](https://twitter.com/smfrogers) explains the nitty gritty of the data.

Also, this [post about process](https://truth-and-beauty.net/projects/waves-of-interest) from Moritz Stefaner is worth a read.
